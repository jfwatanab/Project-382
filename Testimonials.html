<p style="color:orange;font-size:125%;">"If you or your kids are passionate about basketball, this is the place to go! The staff at <I>Michael and Michelle's</i> are incredibly professional, and clearly know what they're talking about. A few short years ago my youngest son wanted to learn basketball, and as a mother you want the best for your kids. Not knowing what "the best" is... not a problem thanks to <I>Michael and Michelle's</I>. Definitely would recommend!"</p>

<p style="color:orange;font-size:125%;">"No proper backyard is complete without a basketball hoop, and the one I got from <I>Micheal and Michelle's</I> did not disappoint. I had bout 2 different hoops previously from both a small "Mom and Pop's" shop, and from a big sports retailer, and both broke with in a few weeks of use. Not only did I pay less with these guys, but this thing is still up!!! Don't waste your time or money elsewhere, there guys are the real deal!"</p>

<p style="color:orange;font-size:125%;">"If you aren't Michael Jordan and a basketball expert, you likely don't know what is and isn't worth your money. <I>Michael and Michelle's</I> definitely takes that problem out of the occasion. Super kind people as well, I felt welcomed and helped the second I walked in the door. I found the prices to be on average a little more than at Dick's, but I felt I was getting what I was paying for."</p>

<p style="color:orange;font-size:125%;">"I'm a high school basketball coach, and these guys have been huge lifesavers... Before Covid, my team and I was playing an away game at a high school that happens to be right next to <I>Michael and Michelle's</i>. After a 2 hour bus ride, w discovered all of our basketballs had been damaged and crushed on the drive, essentially preventing us from having any basketballs to warm up with before the big game! One of the owners "Michelle" was actually at the game, and offered to take us over to the store, and within a matter of minutes she hooked us up with more basketballs than we had even come with in the first place! Can't say enough nice things about this company, definitely check them out!!!"</p>

<p style="color:orange;font-size:125%;">"About what you'd expect, it's a sports store that specializes in basketball. I will say the past 3 pairs of shoes I've gotten from them have not disappointed, but just don't expect them to give you the secret to being the next Lebron. Very kind people; I plan to probably continue shopping here for some time to come."</p>
